      "when someone is put in prison they have at least one interview and assessment to make sure they understand prison rules and procedures know what their rights are get the right healthcare are told of courses available the prisoner gets a prison number and their property is recorded and put somewhere safe until they’re released prisoners are also given a security category based on how

people kept in jail education opportunities and new experiences convict code of conduct vulnerable prisoners arriving at place of confinement interviewing imprisoned criminals prisoners who follow rules can earn privileges this is called the lncentives and earned privileges scheme a prisoner may be able to get more visits from family or friends and may be allowed to spend more money each week prisoners who break prison rules are normally punished they can be kept in their cell for up to days can be given up to extra days in prison on top of their original sentence or the prison can take away some privileges removing a tv from a cell prisoners get the same healthcare as anyone outside prison treatment is free but has to be approved by a prison doctor or member of the healthcare team prisons don’t have hospitals but many have inpatient beds in some cases the prison can get specialist support if prisoners have drug or alcohol problems have hiv or aids are disabled or have a learning difficulty the healthcare team can ask the prisoner’s family doctor for their records but only if the prisoner agrees to it staff are trained to spot prisoners at risk of bullying suicide or selfharm prisoners may get their own case manager who will make sure they are asked about their mental health if they’re feeling depressed most prisons also launch listener schemes that offer emotional support in confidence normally from fellow prisoners prisoners can be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital for their own safety this only happens if they meet certain conditions under the mental health act once the prisoner gets better he returns to prison courses are normally available to help prisoners get new skills learning to read and write use computers and do basic maths most prisoners get an individual learning plan listing courses and training most courses lead to qualifications that are recognized by employers outside prison such as gcses or nvqs prisoners may be able to do a distance learning course in open university many prisoners get the chance to work in prison workshops while carrying out their sentence a lowrisk prisoner may be allowed to work in the community why law it’s the question every wouldbe law student dreads why law that’s a question you’re going to be asked over and over again if you are starting to think a career in law might be the one for you you’ll be answering it on work placement application forms during training interviews at tutor meetings when applying for courses at scholarship interviews the list goes on so if you are at school or college and thinking about a career in law it’s a good idea to start considering how you’re going to answer it and not just because you’d look stupid if you fluffed it once you’ve worked out why law you will find you can apply yourself to the process of achieving your goal in a more focused determined and disciplined manner come on the question seems simple enough what’s the fuss when you’re filling out application forms you need to be structured and logical in your answers a personal question why law can feel somehow unexpected and can be very offputting it is easy to get into a muddle if you have not thought it through the first time i answered this question i was applying for an apprenticeship and had little legal experience i wrote law being a vital component in the successfull integration of people impresses me with its inbuilt readiness to change in accordance with society the longstanding legal system in this country and the relationship between parliament and the courts provide a dynamic professional environment within which to work although i had worked hard at my answer and showed that i knew a little about the legal system i had not thought carefully enough about why i personally was intending to pursue a career in law my answer was not a convincing enough argument and i was unsuccessful as a result ok! just tell me what i need to say many different kinds of people succeed at the law and the best answer really will depend on your personality consider carefully your own reasons and source of motivation we may agree with aristotle that the law is reason free from passion yet an answer as to why you might want a career in law is the opposite it is a rare opportunity to show your passion so do not be afraid to it will help you stand out next to someone else and an interviewer may well remember you by it there are some characteristics that your interviewers tutors and employers will be expecting from you straight away such as how good you might be with clients how much commercial awareness you have and what characteristics you can bring to a role work experience helps prove you are competent in these areas and leaves you with a wealth of examples to talk about on application forms and during interviews so before i leave you to mull over your answer to why law here are three useful tips to improve your chances getting work experience i write a tailored letter targeting a specific person in a firm try requesting one to two days not two weeks as you are more likely to gain shorter placements than longer ones make sure you write a thank you letter it is a good way for you to be remembered positively in case you want to go back why is it advisable to get prepared for the question why law well before you are going to answer it you wont look smart if you fail it you will concentrate better on the process of studying it will be easier for you to attain your ambitious and ultimate aim it will make you more disciplined and determined why did i fail the enrollment for apprenticeship training because i wrote that the legal system in the country is the result of the relationship between parliament and the courts because i considered law as a vital component in the successful integration of people because i knew little about the legal system because i hadnt thought through the personal motives for taking up a career in law what should you do to help you make an interviewer remember you bring as much enthusiasm to the interview as you can prepare concise stories that demonstrate your ability to do the job mention work experience and skills you possess that help you stand out find someone to coach you through the questions what characteristics will an employer be expecting from an applicant immediately ability to research quickly and effectively ability to display a great deal of creativity in problem solving ability to develop excellent interpersonal skills ability to draw reasonable assumptions from limited information which of the following is not true according to the text you have to be clear about your thoughts and intentions experience in legal practice is mandatory for all

to today’s level of about the latest figures again show in western europe prisons are massively overcrowded while chronic staff shortages mean staff cannot even ensure safety we need to take a hard look at sentencing policy the increased use of minimum sentences has tied judges hands and discretion to adopt alternatives to prison where appropriate unless the government gets prisoner numbers down and devotes the resources necessary building a renewed prison estate and providing effective education training and other purposeful activity in every prison all they will be doing is to staunch

      "the cause of crime are you concerned that people worry about crime they do  every day we read it in the papers  a severe crime has been committed the police have arrested someone he has appeared in court and has appealed to his innocence but has been found guilty of his crime  we are all very eased in mind that the criminal is being punished for his misdeeds and innocent citizens can sleep safely and peacefully at night  nevertheless what happens next we all hope that the prisoner will benefit from society’s compensation that a spell in prison will rehab him he will change for better and become like us  we hope that when he is eventually released and let loose on the streets he will be a good character the threat of another spell in prison being a suitable deterrent which will stop him from breaking the law again  evidently let’s face it  the reality is usually very different  the prisoner may be released on parole before the end of his sentence  he will try to reenter society  but then he often becomes a victim himself unable to find work and rejected by society  it isn’t long before he’s back in jail again  what can we do to the criminal to make sure he doesn’t commit another crime there are alternatives to prison such as community service in which he will provide some assistance to those around him  or he can pay a large fine  alternatively we could establish a more severe system of punishment including corporal one and capital punishment but we like to consider ourselves humane and the idea of beating or executing someone is revolting to us  we need to be tough not on the criminal but on the cause of the crime  we should spend less of the taxpayer’s money funding the judges and lawyers and other people who work for the legal system and put the money instead into supporting impoverished areas which are the breeding grounds for crime  we consider that everybody needs a good chance in life  this is a good step forward for the next generation    dealing with the roots of crime public attitude to crime taking benefits from public assistance expectations versus reality offenders should be dealt with by other means than custody expecting prisoners to put their lives back on track vague future of criminals legal system reform  hundreds of properties could be seized in uk corruption crackdown hundreds of british properties suspected of belonging to corrupt politicians tax evaders and criminals could be seized by enforcement agencies under tough new laws designed to tackle london’s reputation as a haven for dirty money  huge amounts of corrupt wealth are laundered through the capital’s banks  much of it ends up in real estate and in other assets such as luxury cars art and jewelry  the criminal finances bill is designed to close a loophole which has left the authorities powerless to seize property from overseas criminals  it will introduce the concept of unexplained wealth orders  the serious fraud office hm revenue and customs and other agencies will be able to apply to the high court for an order forcing the owner of an asset to explain how they obtained the funds to purchase it  the orders will apply to property and other assets worth more than   if the owner fails to demonstrate that a home or piece of jewelry was acquired using legal sources of income agencies will be able to seize it  the law targets not just criminals but politicians and public officials known as politically exposed persons  there are some hundreds of properties in the uk strongly suspected to have been acquired with the proceeds of corruption said the campaign group transparency international the global civil society organization leading the fight against corruption  this will provide lowhanging fruit for immediate action by law enforcement agencies if those agencies are properly resourced  unexplained wealth orders will also help expose the owners of properties  most owners of these companies hide behind anonymous trusts or nominee directors and shareholders  in a single storey apartment complex in london a quarter of the flats are held through offshore companies  those targeted will not need to be resident in the uk  as long as their assets are in the uk an order can be enforced  the law will apply to property acquired before it is introduced  the bill also contains stronger seizure and forfeiture powers designed to make it easier for police and investigators to freeze bank accounts and confiscate assets such as jewelry and art which are harder to seize under current laws  we will not stand by and watch criminals use the uk to launder their dirty money or fund terrorism said the security minister  this legislation will ensure the uk is taking a worldleading role in cracking down on corruption and send a clear message to criminals  we will take your liberty and your money  campaigners say that for the new law to be effective agencies must be given the financial and political support to take powerful and wealthy individuals to court  the uk has a responsibility to ensure that any stolen wealth flowing into the country is stopped frozen and ultimately returned to the people from whom it was stolen said the director of transparency international  why does london have a reputation of a haven for dirty money up to l bn of tainted cash could be passing through the uk each year  corrupt politicians tax evaders and criminals launder billions of dollars  corrupt politicians are still finding the uk to be a safe haven for their illgotten gains  london’s property market has allegedly become a safe haven for laundering money  what changes would be expected after passing the criminal finances bill london would be a safe and convenient place for moneylaunderers  the british capital would be regarded as a haven for corrupt wealth  the uk capital would become insecure place for those who are involved in criminal finances offences  london would be a tough place for overseas criminals  how could the uk benefit from passing the new law the uk would contribute to the worldwide anticorruption and antimoneylaundering actions  law enforcement agencies would get a powerful tool for corruption crackdown  the serious fraud office hm revenue and customs and other agencies will be properly staffed and resourced  the uk would restore its reputation as a corruptionfree area  according to the text what do unexplained wealth orders mean forfeiting of assets seizing the real estates and other assets acquired illegally requiring the explanation and proving legal sources of income for purchasing the property ordering by law enforcement agencies to explain the funds used to purchase the рroperty the following agencies in the uk are responsible for

management into your work habits    look ahead and set a schedule for yourself so that you always have time to be productive  planners are the best things for any student  if you stay uptodate with your homework clubs organizations sports and jobs there’s no way you’ll miss out an activity or forget an assignment  it’s a good idea to update your planner after every class or meeting so you’ll be  sure of deadlines projects and meetings that are approaching in the future  don’t burn daylight don’t keep late hours set achievable goals limit your social networking reward yourself to keep

reminding yourself that you don’t need to check these sites every time you use the computer for school or work  it may seem harmless to go through your networks quickly just to get that feeling of obligation out of the way but it’s easy to get sucked into a time warp this way  remember facebook isn’t conducive to getting work done as much as we all wish it were  you have to be really sure of what it is that you want to get done  if you have homework in several classes various ongoing projects already assigned and tests to study for you’re likely to stay more overwhelmed than focused  this is why it’s important to know what thing you need to do right now  you can only really focus on one thing at a time so decide on some realistic tasks before setting out to tackle any business make sure your schedule includes short periods to recharge and have some fun with friends  you might decide to gift yourself a tasty treat or to give yourself a break after making good progress  if you’re a social media junkie you could even allow yourself to explore facebook guiltfree after getting some work done  you’ll feel less overwhelmed if you have incentives to keep you going bit by bit if you’re having trouble keeping up don’t be afraid to discuss it with your parents or friends  if you feel yourself floundering in a sea of information talk to your teachers  they will answer your

      "you’re amazing so make sure people know it when it comes to telling the world how wonderful you are there’s a fine line between having other people think wow! she’s got so much more about her than i thought and blimey! i wish she’d shut up about herself  it’s easy enough to let everyone around you know you’re something special  the trick is doing it without trying too hard or looking like an attention seeker  so here’s how to get the attention you deserve without screaming look at me!  being loud isn’t a good way to get noticed  quietness and a smile can be more interesting than someone who blurts everything out constantly  be cool instead and show people what you’re really about rather than shouting it in their faces  we are talented! learn to accept yourself  don’t pretend you know everything  idle talk is a bad habit  try to act in good faith  don’t talk behind people’s back  keep your voice down  pursue your interests  it may be tempting to try to bluff your way through a conversation  but if you don’t know much about the subject being discussed you’ll get more kudos if you shut up and listen  you can’t lose  get your facts right and people will respect your wisdom or stay quiet if you’re unsure and people will appreciate your honesty  toning down your gossip factor will show there’s much more to you than people may think  your mates will trust you and your reputation will skyrocket  gossiping gives negative vibes to other people  choose things to do that you love doing and not because everyone else is doing them  if you are passionate about something and enjoying it you’ll have more energy and people will be attracted to you  and you might even be the person who starts a new trend  we may not be superhuman beings but remember each and every one of us has something going on that’s worth shouting about  it’s a fact  everyone is an individual and that’s what makes you who you are  be proud of why you’re different  if you love who you are people are more likely to love you too  rock star    in the masculine universe of rock singersongwriter amy lee fits right in  she brings her goth girl self to the process of composing and to the recording studio no questions asked  the cofounder and lead vocalist for evanescence lets her unrelenting strength and sheer determination push through a downpour of adrenalineamped guitar riffs with her soothing classically trained piano stylings   evanescence brings to the forefront heartpounding musical compositions fronted by lee’s supernatural yet realitycrashing vocals  with the debut of their album the open door lee views the journey that led her to this point of selfrealization  in the world of musical geniuses lee stands out simply because she realizes that it’s worth going on your own  her mantra trust yourself  believe in yourself   in keeping with their tradition of supreme independence the little rock arkansas band didn’t follow the tried and tired route to becoming a stadium pleaser  ten years back then yearold lee and former cofounder ben moody paired up and focused their energies on creating a new sound  they decided to go on their own and build their band up slowly and fiercely   fate didn’t come knocking but rather it practically blew the door off its hinges in the  spring of  when evanescence’s debut album fallen hit the airwaves  fallen sold more than  million albums globally and was certified gold or platinum in over  countries  and in  evanescence was nominated for five grammy awards  they’ve got two including the biggie best new artist   and the grammy experience it feels like you are in high school collecting all of your awards at the end of the year lee laughs  i really appreciate those who took the time to understand our sound  i was stoked  when she heard their name called i didn’t expect it lee remembers  i had my shoes off so of course had to put them back on   armed with their second album and its first single with the title call me when you’re sober lee talks about her natural growth as a female artist and coming to terms with her artistic freedom  i didn’t want to make the same album twice  now i was allowed to grow and that gave me confidence as an artist   now with the open door lee at the ripe age of  is a competent artist who knows exactly what she wants  and that is her advice for women trying to break into the biz you have to feel what is right in your heart  if someone is telling you to do something just because it’s good for business it’s a lie  just trust yourself it may take longer but not everybody knows what they are talking about  according to the first paragraph which of the following is true of amy lee she is equally keen on singing and songwriting  she makes a lot of efforts to succeed in rock  she can play both the guitar and classical piano  she pushed hard to set up evanescence  according to the author amy lee is outstanding because she    fronts an otherwise male rock group has reached the point of selfrealization has unique vocal capabilities stays independent in the world of rock what does the author mean by saying that the band didn’t follow the tried and tired route to becoming a stadium pleaser line    the band was tired of performing at the stadiums  the band tried to pave their own way to popularity  the band failed to please a majority of listeners  the band tried to keep independent traditions of rock  n stating i was stoked line  amy lee means that she was   hardly surprised very amused extremely pleased well prepared which of the following best characterizes amy lee at present she has become an experienced performer  she’s gained confidence in doing business  she is not afraid of the stage any longer  she is confident enough to perform alone

many small mammals are physically easy to care for    a lowermaintenance small pet is the fancy rat which lives about  years  rodents are very social and it’s good to get a pair at a time just make sure they are the same gender! rats need grains and meat protein which can be provided with dry dog food or mealworms  domestic rats usually aren’t aggressive however make sure you choose a pet from a reputable store or breeder    rabbits are also gentle and lowmaintenance but they can live at least  years  rabbits generally eat pellets and plenty of green vegetables they will also eat hay  they like to be held but shouldn’t be handled too much the first few days after purchasing in order to adjust  rabbits need plenty of outofcage exercise many pet stores carry rabbit leashes    even small mammals need plenty of space  for any small mammal choose a cage with a solid bottom rather than a wire one to prevent injuries to the paws  a rabbit needs a cage or hutch of at least   feet wide by   feet long by  feet deep  rabbits can be kept outside but make sure their hutch is wellsheltered  small mammals need bedding for their homes shredded paper or paper towels work best  wood shavings work as well    bedding needs to be changed about  times a week  when choosing a small pet always be sure to look for alert brighteyed animals with smooth coats   that’s a good sign too  if an animal also expresses interest in you so they are a serious commitment but avoid cedar or pine chips because of the oil they contain if brushed with a baby’s hairbrush so you can keep your pet close by when outside so as social animals they do better in pairs but require a lot of attention and affection so as not to get bitten don’t be a couch potato there are plenty of things to do summer  the one word on every student’s  before finals even start  but now that it is here what are you going to do many face the tough decision of finding a fun activity to do especially in a state as hot as arizona  if you’re staying in arizona during the summer don’t worry because there are  for you to do  the beautiful scenery of arizona makes the state an excellent one for outdoor fun  lake havasu is also an outstanding spot that accommodates you with swimming jetskiing and even fishing  there are also a few theme parks here that are great fun and  your adrenaline up  but if you’re not an outdoor person and you’d rather stay nice and cool inside there are plenty of activities for you too and no playing on the computer all day is not one  arizona offers a  of malls all over the place  malls are a great way to stay cool while getting some minimal exercise as well  so if you’re sitting at home with nothing to do grab some friends and try at least one of these activities you’ll be sure to  it  for those of you who plan on leaving the state but don’t know exactly where to go i have a piece of advice  california is one of the biggest vacation spots but that’s because it gives you so many choices of what to do  disneyland is the main  you should visit if you’re visiting california and if you can’t then go catch some waves at mission bay beach  colorado is another great vacationing spot

pigeons really get home homing pigeons  for their uncanny internal compass yet a new study reveals that sometimes the birds get home the same way we do they follow the roads  tim guilford and dora biro at england’s oxford university followed pigeons in oxford over a  period using tiny tracking devices equipped with global positioning system technology  by swiss and italian colleagues  what they discovered was surprising  within ten kilometers of home the pigeons relied less on their wellknown talents for decoding the sun’s position or deciphering the earth’s magnetic field to help them navigate  instead they opted for a habitual route that followed linear features in the landscape such as roads rivers railways and hedge lines  even when it wasn’t  direct way home  it was almost comical says guilford  one pigeon followed a road to a roundabout then exited onto a major road that led to a second roundabout  others flew down the river thames only to make a  turn at a bridge  guilford suggests that sticking to a memorized linear route may actually make homing more reliable  and easier  it made me smile to see it says guilford  you can imagine yourself flying along a road

      "body language  shaking hands is a polite gesture indicating friendship and acceptance  at one time however meeting with a stranger aroused suspicion and fear  to prevent each other from suddenly attacking strangers joined right hands as a solemn promise of nonaggression thus demonstrating that neither party was about to use a weapon  handshaking is now an activity practiced by both men and women not only to greet one another but to seal a contract as well  showing that you are wrong denoting a state of being concentrated showing an aim of avoiding negative consequences demonstrating your peaceful aims indicating a feeling of being helpless expressing approval or disapproval expressing a feeling of being astonished denoting that everything іs fine the american ok sign the joining of the thumb and forefinger in a circle indicates that all is well or perfect  the ok sign acquired its modern connotation from the ancient world in which the circle itself was one of the oldest and most common symbols for perfection  the verbal expression ok is native to the united states and was formed in support of the letter o indicating that something was as perfect as a circle when not used in hitchhiking the thumbsup gesture in american culture typically indicates i like that while the thumbsdown gesture indicates your negative feelings towards something  the gesture has been linked to the time of the roman arena where the emperor supposedly ordered life or death for a gladiator by turning thumbs up or thumbs down crossing one’s fingers serves as protection from bad luck or from the penalties associated with lying  thus when people wish for good luck they cross their fingers and when they wish not to be responsible for a lie they cross their fingers and hide their arms behind their backs to not let on that they are lying by sticking out their tongues people react to situations that may be unpleasant for them  such displays indicate laughing or rejection  for example children often stick out their tongues to tease each other  or they may also stick out their tongues in reaction to activities requiring undistracted attention hence the tongueshowing of children focused on their homework it’s rare for travellers to return from namibia with anything other than highly favourable praise  what makes namibia so special is how easy it is to take a safari that won’t break anyone’s bank account  with little population and enough mineral resources to make it one of africa’s wealthiest countries namibia though somewhat troubled by land reform issues is largely a model of peace stability and interethnic respect  if you’re confident behind the wheel you can travel totally independently staying at simple campsites or fabulously designed bush lodges as you go  distances in namibia might be long but the roads are generally in reasonable shape meaning a x is rarely needed for much of the country  it’s also a very safe country with delinquency against tourists very rare indeed even in the bigger towns which frankly are still virtual villages  it’s true that you don’t get the high density of wildlife here that you might find in some other african countries but an enormous richness of flora and fauna and relative lack of crowds make namibia one of the best safari destinations in africa  namibia was the first place i really travelled in africa  with the exception of the zambezi region most of namibia is comprised of harsh and inhospitable desert but i’ve always found it extremely beautiful  the iconic views of the dunes certainly live up to even the highest of expectations particularly in the early morning light  the namibian sand was calling my name so i grabbed my kalahari ferraris sand boards and hit the dunes  i didn’t even have time to catch my breath and i was pushed over the edge  my heart was thumping in my chest as i was going downhill  after the adrenaline burst i wandered the beach and streets of swakopmund and came across the world’s largest quartz crystal cluster  my next stop was cape cross home to over  cape fur seals half of them were onemonthold pups  the moment we saw the seals my mouth dropped open  many of the adorable pups were taking their first swim in the ocean  then something awesome yet scary happened it was charged by a seal  he was trapped in the pathway and thought i was in his breeding area  at first it was kind of fun having the seal so close to me but when he bared his teeth i ran as fast as i could to the truck  next i was off to brandberg  on my way i visited a local himba village and learnt about their culture and purchased some traditional crafts  the himba people rub their bodies in a red organic dye and fat to protect them from the harsh desert climate

following is true of the author’s trip across the namibian deserts he drove fast cars across the deserts  he looked for a crystal deposit in the sands  he was excited about sliding down the dunes  he had to cross a desert to get to the sea shore  why did the seal chase the traveller because he did research on the seals habitat  because he trespassed on the seal’s territory  because he was moving about too quickly  because he was watching the seal pups  how do the himba tribe protect themselves from the local climate by wearing traditional clothes by covering their skin with substances by

      "coping with writing anxiety  start writing at whatever point you like  if you want to begin in the middle fine  leave the introduction or first section until later  the reader will never know that you wrote the paper beginning with the main body  besides some writers routinely save the introduction until later when they have a clearer idea of what the main idea and purpose will be  aim your writing at different addressees discuss your essay with someone else reread your notes imagine yourself in different roles record your composition write a plan of your paper try writing backwards bear information in your mind talk the paper to someone — your teacher a friend a roommate a tutor in the writing lab  just pick someone who’s willing to give you fifteen to thirty minutes to talk about the topic and whose main aim is to help you start writing  have the person take notes while you talk or record your conversation  talking will be helpful because you’ll probably be more natural and spontaneous in speech than in writing  your listener can ask questions and guide you as you speak and you’ll feel more as though you’re telling someone about something than completing an assignment  talk into a recorder imagining your audience sitting in chairs or standing in a group  then transcribe the recorded material  you’ll at least have some ideas down on paper to work with and move around    pretend that you’re writing to a child to a close friend to a parent to a person who sharply disagrees with you to someone who’s new to the subject and needs to have you explain your paper’s topic slowly and clearly  changing the audience can clarify your purpose  who am i writing to when i explain how to change the oil in a car that guy down the hall who’s always asking everyone for help  changing the audience can also make you feel more comfortable and help you write more easily    pretend you are someone else writing the paper  for instance assume you are the president of a strong feminist movement and are asked to write about sexist advertising  or pretend you are the president of a major oil company asked to defend the high price of oil  consider being someone in another time period perhaps abraham lincoln or someone with a different perspective from your own on things someone living in hiroshima at the time the bomb was dropped  pulling yourself out of your usual perspective can help you think more about the subject than writing about the subject  my greek christmas family bonding takes on new meaning in my loud loving family  every christmas my entire family overstuffs their suitcases and heads over to my grandparents house for a vacation filled with comfort food and family bonding  but this is not just any family bonding this is customary greek family bonding  driving up to the house is an experience in itself  on their street we pass about  cars all with cleverly titled greekthemed license plates only to find my grandpa in the yard decorating a miniature replica of the parthenon with blue and white lights  we step inside the door to an overwhelming greeting and  kisses later  every year it never fails  i wander around their house in search of a majestic christmas tree  and every year i find a tall basket of tomatoes standing in for it instead  after my discovery or rediscovery of the glowing tomato temple’ i watch my baby cousins torture the greek gods — also known as the cats — kosta aristotle and athena  the dinner bell has been politely rung otherwise known as my grandma banging her spoon against a bowl and in a matter of seconds there is utter chaos and there is no other way of describing it  looking into the kitchen i see four loaves of bread  stuffed tomatoes a platter of freshly sliced lamb a massive greek salad an equally massive peasant salad giant lemon shrimp and of course a beautiful block of feta cheese  we all sit down to eat and soon enough all my greatuncles are screaming at each other about money or greek politics  news flash they have all lived in america for the past  years  by the end of dinner grandma takes out the cd player for a little tsifteteli and kalamatiano  and then we dance in circles around the kitchen until we can’t see straight and return to the table only to find more food being served for us — watermelon grapes cookies and coffee  it is almost three in the morning now and i figure when the greek alphabet is racing through my mind that i am unable to think and must retire to my plasticcovered couch  as i lie there i suddenly realize how truly lucky i am  i was graced with such a vibrant loving culture and wouldn’t change it for the world  sure my big greek family can be overwhelming with their eating and kissing and dancing but the love they have for each other is so obvious and so comforting  when i spend time with my greek relatives i feel where i belong  furthermore growing up greek has taught me to appreciate the different cultures that this world has to offer  i wake up the next morning to find my whole family singing greek christmas songs with santa     dressed in a toga  merry christmas kala christouyenna feliz navidad however you want to say it and i hope you cherish your family time as much as i do  what is true of the cars near the house of the author’s grandparents they had greek registration numbers  they had specially decorated number plates  they belonged to the grandparents neighbours  they blocked the driveway to the house  what did the author say about the christmas tree in her grandparents house it was tall and majestically decorated  it was standing in the middle of the yard  it was replaced by a container of vegetables  it was illuminated with blue and white lights  why did the author’s grandmother hit her spoon against a bowl she wanted to attract the kids attention  she invited everybody to have a meal  she tried to handle the chaos in the kitchen  she decided to tap traditional greek music  it can be inferred from the text that tsifteteli and kalamatiano are    national customs festive dishes traditional dances local fruit which of the following is not mentioned in the text greeks traditionally have close family relationships  knowing one culture helps you respect others  greeks tend to be overweight because of eating too much  family gatherings are a good way to learn national customs    this is a prime example of what can be called a quality awful film  this is one of those movies that have you wondering  long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began how did someone not say um we have a big problem with this story which movie  is based on a poor plot is boring for part of the audience will have a continuation is appreciated by young viewers is a story of a screenwriter has been unfairly criticized was shot on a location in space boasts positive reviews while the complex special effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat you can’t shake that feeling that it’s all one wile e  coyote gag from a looney tunes cartoon  if this is the end this is a good one    but of course another sequel has already been announced завдання  з  directed by tim johnson it has a bright candycoloured look with a few fancy d effects and some wonderfully detailed sets  steve martin voices smek  jennifer lopez lends her voice to the role of tip’s mother  the soundtrack features a number of rihanna tunes  anyone over  will see the plot twists a mile away  kids will enjoy a goofy race of aliens called boovs the rainbows of colours and the music  it’s a film about a scenarist worried about writing a romantic comedy script because he’s never been in love even as he falls for someone  it’s a smart script but it’s also completely overwritten as every line feels like it’s been carefully crafted to be absolutely hilarious  thankfully the cast adds some charm to the screen and the genuinely witty script keeps the audience laughing  it’s long loud and overloaded with effects  what it doesn’t have is any sense of going above and beyond  unlike some other entries in the marvel universe it doesn’t transcend its boundaries  fans of the series will be pleased but those looking in from the outside of comicbook culture will find themselves looking at their watches  it’s a perfectly friendly comedy  it’s not as funny as the first film but it is funny enough  but for some reason it has become subject to some of the most sarcastic reviews in recent memory  reading over a sampling of them it is difficult to figure out why  at least audiences seem to like blart’s latest adventure    cowboy chocolatier on the rare days when i happen to glimpse my distant and longago life as a child i remember my love of chocolate  i also remember cowboys — mostly through the medium of television  growing up on the wrong side of the pond    they seemed a pretty strong breed likely to be found out in the wilderness somewhere with a horse a gun and not much else  much later i was fortunate enough to move to where some real cowboys live — cody wyoming  tim kellogg the meeteetse chocolatier was named as one of wyoming’s  under  for  proving beyond a doubt that  and turn his knowledge and passion into a successful business operation  he runs both a meeteetse store and an online business  tim can be found in his store — dressed in true cowboy style — with his signature black hat  inside the chocolates are displayed to good effect with tim’s motto fear no chocolate inscribed on a blackboard by the door  tim is proud of all his chocolates some of which he explains are the traditional flavours — baileys champagne —   while others are unique local treats specific to their community and to their creator’s cowboy heritage  tim fell into chocolatemaking by accident in the s to keep chocolate in the family after his grandmother died  thus   tim decided that he would be the backer and chocolatemaker for family occasions and began to make confections for his friends and family  he is the sole chocolatier in his business  a few miles outside of meeteetse  this combination of roles can be seen unusual but tim is happy to note that although his friends do find it funny   found in fine chocolatiers all over the globe cowboys were unknown and mystical to me they are made with fresh natural and organic products this cowboy knows how to make delicious goodies and still spends two to four days a week cowboying on a ranch they have never been negative in an almost certainly unusual move for a cowboy this unexpected decision made him famous paper plane that flew higher than a jet many of us built paper planes to  around the classroom but a team of british

college  but many forget to have a good time during the years they do play because they’re so focused on winning  and unfortunately parents and coaches sometimes put too much pressure on athletes

comes naturally and a bad memory as something that cannot be changed but actually there is a lot that you can do to improve your memory  however it does mean taking responsibility and making an effort  here are the experts top tips  we all remember the things we are interested in and forget the ones that bore us  this no doubt explains the reason why schoolboys remember football results effortlessly but struggle with dates from their history lessons! take an active interest in what you want to remember and focus on it consciously  one way to make yourself more interested is to ask questions — the more the better  repeating things is the best way to remember things for a short time e g  remembering a phone number for a few seconds  multiple numbers would be impossible for most of us to remember   but look at them in chunks and it becomes much easier      another way to make something more memorable is to think about something visual associated with it  design a mental picture and the stranger the picture the better you will remember it! if an english person studying spanish wanted to remember the spanish word for duck pato’ heshe could associate it with the english verb to pat and imagine a picture of someone patting a duck on the head  to remember long lists try inventing a story which includes all the items you want to remember  in experiments people were asked to remember up to  words using this technique and when they were tested afterwards on average they could remember ninety percent of them  if we organize what we know in a logical way then when we learn more about that subject we understand that better and so add to our knowledge more easily  make wellorganized notes  be sure things are clear in your mind  if not ask questions until you understand! many experts believe that listening to music helps people to organize their ideas more clearly and so improves their memory  sadly not all sorts of music have the same effect  if you do not want to lose your memory as you get older you need to keep your brain fit just like your body use it or lose it is the experts advice  logic puzzles crosswords and mental arithmetic are all good mental aerobics  exercise is also important for your memory because it increases your heart rate and sends more oxygen to your brain and that makes your memory work better  exercise also reduces stress which is very bad for the memory  the old saying that eating fish makes you brainy may be true after all  scientists have discovered that the fats found in fish like tuna sardines and salmon — as well as in olive oil—help to improve the memory  vitamins c and e found in fruits like oranges strawberries and red grapes and vitamin b found in lean meat and green vegetables are all good brain food too  what is a good memory according to paragraph l a «gift» of nature at birth something staying invariable a result of your selfperfection something easy to develop which of the following techniques for memorizing a lot of new words at a time is mentioned in the text asking people the meaning of these words drawing pictures of the meaning of the words writing lists of associations with other words creating compositions with the new words according to the text which of the following statements is not true stress reduction has a negative influence on memory  «mental aerobics» includes

smart the famous baseball player yogi berra once said you can’t think and hit the ball at the same time  a professional player  may not be thinking very much but he or she is using his brain in a very focused and expert manner  the player’s brain likely builds a mental model of the game called a forward model so    let’s say a soccer goalkeeper is watching a forward approach with the ball  his brain is already building on previous experience to predict whether    mirror neurons likely help sports players make these predictions  when you watch someone else do something like kick a ball your mirror neurons fire as if   even if you’re standing still  salvatore aglioti of sapienza university of rome thinks that professional athletes use mirror neurons to track their opponents actions and anticipate what will happen next  in a study aglioti asked professional basketball players novices and sports scouts to watch the body motion of a player taking a shot    could they figure out if it did compared to novices and sports scouts elite athletes were better at predicting the outcome of a shot after watching the body motion of basketball players aglioti told science news  can you predict a shot in basketball just   that seems incredible! his brain can stay one step ahead of the action you were the one kicking the ball you’re playing basketball and make three shots in a row from watching someone’s arms when they throw hoping that your winning streak will continue about to take a shot in basketball or a swing in baseball without seeing if the ball went in the net the forward

      "some psychological tricks to make people like you immediately most friendships develop so naturally that you dont even realize how or when they started  sometimes though you want to make an effort to befriend a new acquaintance or become a better friend to existing pals  read on to find out how to develop better relationships faster   this strategy is called mirroring and involves mimicking the other person’s behaviour  in  new york university researchers documented the chameleon effect which occurs when people unconsciously mimic each other’s behaviour and this facilitates liking  the psychological experiments showed that the participants were more likely to say that they liked their partner when their partner had mimicked their behaviour  expect good things from people encourage people to talk about themselves spend more time together with others emphasize the shared values compliment other people always be in a good mood tell people your secrets imitate other people people tend to like things that are familiar to them  it was discovered that college students who lived closer together were more likely to be friends than students who lived farther apart  this could be because students who live close by can experience more daytoday interactions with each other  under certain circumstances those interactions can develop into friendships  even if you don’t live near your friends try sticking to a steady routine with them such as going out for coffee every week or taking a class together    people will associate the adjectives you use to describe other people with your personality  according to gretchen rubin whatever you say about other people influences how people see you  if you describe someone else as genuine and kind people will also associate you with those qualities  the reverse is also true if you are constantly trashing people behind their backs your friends will start to associate the negative qualities with you as well    people are more attracted to those who are similar to them  this is known as the similarityattraction effect  in his experiment theodore newcomb measured his subjects attitudes on controversial topics and then put them in a universityowned house to live together  by the end of their stay the subjects liked their housemates more when they had similar attitudes about the topics that were measured  if you hope to get friendly with someone try to find a point of similarity between you two and highlight it    selfdisclosure may be one of the best relationshipbuilding techniques  you can try this technique on your own as youre getting to know someone  for example you can build up from asking them about their last trip to the movies to learning about the people who mean the most to them in life  when you learn personal information about another person they are likely to feel closer to you and want to confide in you in the future    cooking in the classroom elementary! the workplace of professional chef catherine pressler is a former storage room at hunters woods elementary school  outside room  a sign proclaims chef pressler food fundamentals  this is where students come to take part in a cookingbased course which began several years ago when pressler was looking for a way to be active in her children’s school  her kids aren’t in elementary school anymore but pressler has stayed  named parent teacher association pta volunteer of the year she is the creator of a highly detailed and organised series of classes for kindergarten through sixth grade that adds to themes from daily course work  how is cooking connected with math science or history just look kindergartners whip up a recipe inspired by a popular children’s tale stone soup as they handle the ingredients they learn about geometric shapes sorting identification of fruits and vegetables and the five senses  lessons become more complex for the older kids  fourthgraders prepare a grand menu from colonial virginia to review the state’s history culture and natural resources  hunters woods principal stephen hockett says everything she does is amazing  to have children use their thinking skills and make connections to the real world is incredible  when kids are having a good time is when they learn the most  pressler spends up to  hours a week preparing lessons buying supplies and teaching  she volunteers her time the supply budget comes from student fees the pta and sometimes her own pocket  the program has grown so large that pressler is looking for grants and other sources of income  you have to see pressler in action to truly understand the scope of her program and her dedication to the kids  on a spring afternoon in room  thirdgrade students arrive to find gleaming stainlesssteel pasta machines and other carefully organized supplies waiting on clean tabletops  pressler isn’t two minutes into the lesson before she gives the first hints that the program is about a lot more than cooking  pressler manages to talk without stopping but without losing her young audience  their eyes follow her as she springs around the room discussing history and geography pulling down a world map here and pointing to an architectural poster there  pulling out packages of pasta she wows the kids with the variety of ingredients used to make different kinds of it including soy buckwheat rice corn and rye  soon the class is shrieking with delight as they run dough through pasta machines and measure it for the longestnoodle contest  pressler is a role model with a diverse background  i went to school in architecture and interior design  i’d always loved science so then i went to graduate school in textile chemistry  then i said i’m going to chef school now as a hobby  and i found that’s where my heart was  i worked as a pastry chef for a number of years and really loved that  she missed interacting with more people however  pressler says she dreams of expanding the program to reach more students at other schools or taking her program to television  her recipe for success is to integrate learning with life instill enthusiasm for learning in the children and inspire them to achieve their heart’s desire  which of the following is true of catherine pressler according to paragragh  pressler used to cook meals for elementary school pupils  pressler started her foodbased course at the pta’s request  pressler’s work at school earned her public recognition  pressler’s kids gave her the idea of food fundamentals  what can be inferred from paragragh  about pressler’s course it teaches children practical skills  it requires quick thinking  it is provided free of charge  it is arranged for one age group    what problems does pressler face in teaching her course creating the menu for pupils searching for additional financing getting the necessary ingredients clearing up the mess after classes   which of the following is not true of pressler’s teaching techniques she captures students attention  she holds competitions in class  she applies an interdisciplinary approach  she conducts her lessons outdoors    what are pressler’s plans for the future to open her own bakery to continue her education to widen her audience to develop her own recipes   famous castles tintagel castle after a period as a roman settlement and military outpost tintagel great

      "some rules for learning at any age no matter how good you think you are at doing several tasks at the same time you arent  enough studies have shown that if youre doing more than one thing at a time especially when it comes to learning your speed and attention drops off  it’s better to spend  uninterrupted minutes a day on the topic youve decided to master than an hour of distracted learning  don’t get discouraged dont multitask keep regular hours for learning don be afraid to ask for help don’t delay doing your work be ready to practice a lot choose hard things to learn try various learning methods if you’re picking up a new language learning or relearning to play an instrument or starting to paint you probably already realise that you will have to put in the time  there is just no way around it those who are the best at a given subject are those who work on it most  you may have heard of the  hours theory from malcolm gladwell’s book outliers — that it takes that much time to become expert at anything  if it’s difficult to do something even maddening at times you’re more likely to really remember it  learning what’s easy s like writing in sand here today and gone tomorrow  when youre stuck on a difficult passage that doesn’t seem to make sense or when you keep making mistakes solving a problem — this is when the most valuable learning is happening    most people think that learning in their preferred way is better  some like to read things auditory learners like to hear information aloud while visual learners like images graphs and liveaction descriptions  but just because it’s easier to learn in a certain style doesn’t mean it’s really better  you learn better when you don’t limit instruction or experience to the style youre used to    failures occur in any business learning attempt or project  every successful person has gone through this part of the process sometimes multiple times  when you don’t feel like youre getting anywhere you often feel depressed  many people give up at this stage  you must keep going to achieve your goals  just keep going and youre sure to succeed  the growing gap in any period of rapid social change age may become as important an identitymarker as differences between social and ethnic groups  any immigrant family for example joins in a process of rapid identity change  an extraordinary proportion of today’s school children are immigrant children or children of immigrants  in some us cities the numbers range up to sixty percent some schools are a virtual un of immigrant children  when children go to school they may make friends from a very different kind of background and they usually become fluent in a new language  typically an intergenerational gap appears at least one parent may speak both the language of their own parent and that of the country they have settled in  children however may not share a language in common with grandparents  such experience can be stressful for each generation and it can create burdens on young children who have to act as intermediaries and interpreters for older family members  this kind of intergenerational language shift is now occurring within countries as migration to cities or rapid economic and social development create a very different type of world where children grow up  in shanghai for example where putonghua has become the language of education and where english is introduced in primary school at grade  a new generation of children are growing up who may have difficulty in communicating with grandparents in the family language of shanghainese  in several asian countries we can see a similar language shift within families  singapore provides one of the bestdocumented examples  gradually english has shifted from being a second language to become the main language of the home  in india a similar phenomenon has occurred in middle class families and the number of such families is rising  english is often the language in which young people form relationships in young adulthood  mothers and fathers may have different linguistic backgrounds in which case family communication typically takes place in english  we are now witnessing a further development in many societies however  change is occurring so rapidly that differences emerge not just between generations but between siblings a yearold girl may find a cultural and linguistic gap with her yearold brother  this is not just an issue for asia  within europe a new middle class professional elite is emerging in which families move country every few years  a consequence is that children within the same family may have quite different linguistic loyalties and proficiencies  traditionally the family has been regarded central to the reproduction of linguistic and ethnic identity  in times of rapid change international movement smaller families and new patterns of childcare community institutions and resources may be just as important  what is stated in paragraph  about immigrant children they try to learn their native language from their grandparents  they lose fluency in their own native language with time  they help their grandparents to converse in a new language  they are burdened with getting skills in a new language  the author uses the example of shanghai to illustrate that  this city has expanded due to the fast economic growth shanghais citizens observe asian cultural traditions english has become a means of instruction in the local schools languages taught at school may replace the family language which of the following is true of the language shift in asian countries it influences the number of international marriages  it occurs only in the families with young children  it has been officially registered in one of these countries  it reflects the change of the social status of the family    why does a linguistic gap between children within the same family emerge in europe because children grow in different linguistic environments  because younger children are keen on learning asian languages  because elder children prefer to speak english in private  because children have parents with different mother tongues    which of the following is not mentioned as a factor in forming the linguistic and ethnic identity of a person relationships migration worldview education us camps for kids camp wicosuta new hampshire

ceu    the candy man can knowing my weakness for all things sugary a friend recently gave me a wonderful gift a framed candybar wrapper dating back to the great depression  the odd name of the bar chicken dinner was accented by the label art a steaming chicken  sad to say chicken dinner did not include any actual chicken parts  it was mostly nuts and chocolate  but why would a confectioner name a chocolate bar after a sunday meal this is a profound question in itself of course but it also highlights an odd fact at times of economic crisis while most manufacturers are struggling companies such as hershey’s and nestle are reporting increased sales  apparently there is nothing more soothing to the financially insecure than a candy bar however oddly named  to understand why requires a look back at our past  both in the old world and the new chocolate was consumed exclusively by the aristocracy and in liquid form  the technology required to render chocolate into a solid form came along only in the midth century  but it took world war i for the chocolate bar to emerge as a distinct culinary product  american companies began massproducing bars as singleserving rations for the soldiers  when the dough boys returned to the states they encouraged the domestic demand for candy bars  ironically it was the beginning of the depression that actually resulted in the golden age of candy bars  what had been just a century earlier the ultimate luxury foodstuff became manna for the masses  according to the late ray broekel the author of the great american candy bar book more than  distinct brands were introduced during the depression  candy bars might be regarded as america’s first fast food cheap selfcontained and filling — at least in the shortterm  the variety of regionally made bars available back then was dazzling  most major cities had confectioners producing bars and big cities such as chicago and boston boasted dozens  the range of components included local nuts and produce such as pecans walnuts strawberries cherries and figs  no doubt the strangest bar to be introduced during the boom was the infamous vegetable sandwich produced for quite a short while during the health craze of the s  billed as a delicious candy made with vegetables the bar consisted of dehydrated celery peas and carrots covered in chocolate  while it’s true that the vegetable sandwich probably lived up to its marketing tag — will not constipate — it never quite caught on with the public  still what people wanted then was a dessert that they could convince themselves was healthy  the same holds true today  consolidation by industrial giants such as hershey’s and mars has long since driven most regional bars out of existence and a much smaller number of national brands has emerged  but brands like snickers continue to be marketed as satisfying read filling and nutritious snacks  nor is it any surprise that retail candy sales have been strong during the current recession  candy bars remain an incredibly affordable luxury products that simultaneously deliver a sugar high and a nostalgic feeling of excitement by reminding consumers of the innocent pleasures of childhood  what surprised the author according to paragraph  the date of the candybar production the value of the candybar wrapper the name of the old candy bar the ingredients of the sunday meal which of the following is true of chocolate according to the text chocolate has become americans favourite dessert  chocolate used to be the privilege of the nobility  chocolate was first made solid during world war i  chocolate drinks were invented during the great depression    what does the author mean by writing that the vegetable sandwich never quite caught on with the public in paragraph    it was not popular with the consumers  it was not available in small towns  it was not considered a health food  it was not affordable to the customers    which of the following is not mentioned in the text the author of the text has a strong liking for sweet foods  soldiers contributed to spreading candy bars in the usa  candybar recipes contained various local ingredients  consolidation of big brands made candy bars cheaper    what is stated in the text chocolate sells in greater amounts when economy is in decline  chocolate candy bars are healthier than other fast food  the number of chocolate brands is constantly growing  customers choice of candy bars depends on their ingredients    unforgettable holidays yellowstone winter family tour introduce your family to the magic of yellowstone in winter

call it home  giant tortoises are native to the seychelles but have been killed off on most of the other islands  brendon has been gradually reintroducing them to his corner of the indian ocean painting them with identifying numbers and giving them names such as alice florita and four degrees south  he first arrived there on holiday in the late fifties restless and seeking adventure after years spent working as a newspaperman in africa  i knew the moment i set foot on the island that it was the right place for me he said  brendon hired his own man friday a seychellois called rene lafortune who helped him transform moyenne  together they planted palm trees mango and pawpaw saved rainwater and pumped it up the hillside by hand  when he arrived there were no birds on the island so he brought ten from a neighbouring island  brendon started feeding them and more birds settled on the island  but we werent doing it to make it into a national park or anything like that said brendon  we were doing it to make it habitable for me  a saudi prince once offered him a blank cheque for moyenne but brendon certainly isn’t selling  the only reason someone would want to buy this island is to build a big hotel he said  yes of course he wants to keep his hideaway unspoiled but perhaps he still has hopes of finding the pirate treasure rumoured to be buried somewhere on the

mountain climbing  when i began studying cultural anthropology and archaeology at the university of arizona i saw unlimited possibilities for combining the outdoor skills id learned with anthropology in remote parts of the world  the next step seemed only logical i decided id learn more by studying anthropology in a foreign country since id be living anthropology while studying it in a different language  once i had studied cinematography and learned to analyse unwritten languages i felt ready for the career id foreseen for myself while still a boy anthropological research  with anthropology my desire to visit littleknown places could be combined with my interest in understanding other cultures  to me it seemed like i would be solving mysteries  i was fascinated by questions like why did people in the past build such unusual structures such as giant drawings in the sand in such difficult places such as mountaintops how can someone become an explorer it is not necessary to be a great athlete but it is necessary to be fit and to know how to take care of oneself and others in an emergency  practical skills such as mapping and auto repair are always useful! key is speaking a foreign

      "tips for killer presentations becoming a competent rather than just confident speaker requires a lot of practice  but here are a few things you can consider to start sharpening your presentation skills  speeches should be entertaining and informative  i’m not saying you should act like a dancing monkey when giving a serious presentation  but unlike an email or article people expect some appeal to their emotions  simply reciting dry facts without any passion or humour will make people less likely to pay attention  don’t make excuses don’t mumble dont speak too fast take questions from the audience get ready beforehand dont be dull mind your body language avoid reading your notes nothing is worse than a speaker you can’t hear  even in the hightech world of microphones and amplifiers you need to be heard  projecting your voice doesn’t mean yelling rather standing up straight and letting your voice resonate on the air in your lungs rather than in the throat to produce a clearer sound    any gestures you make need to be an extension of your message and any emotions that message conveys  planned gestures look false because they don’t match your other involuntary movements that your body cues  youd be better off keeping your hands to your side    don’t adjust a projector or fumble with powerpoint when people are waiting for you to speak  come early scope out the room run through your slide show and make sure there wont be any holdbacks  moreover preparation can do a lot to remove your speaking anxiety    apologies are only useful if you’ve done something wrong  don’t use them to account for incompetence or humble yourself in front of your audience  don’t apologise for your nervousness or a lack of preparation time  most audience members can’t detect your anxiety so don’t draw attention to it    my hometown by christina l  if you were to look at cutler you would probably be reminded of a norman rockwell picture  the smalltown atmosphere and caring people give it an oldfashioned quality that is not often duplicated  surrounded by thick rugged firs and the chilled atlantic ocean this habitat is home to as few as  yearround residents together with summer guests  i have lived among this untamed coastal beauty all my life as have my mother and her mother as well  my grandmother spent her early years on an island in the mouth of the harbour  her stories of these unique days are rich with tidal waters and family togetherness  the quaint size of my seaside home gives its residents special qualities  people of cutler have smalltown values  they pull together in times of joy and need  whenever my father needs help more than enough hands always seem to appear and get the job done  these same hands are also there to give him a pat on the back or a round of applause  a certain uniqueness is applied to jobs of cutler as well  many of its residents make their earnings by working off the land  through the fogfilled summer mornings you can always see shellfish scattered across the muddy flats  faithful cutler fishermen slip out of the harbour before the sun creeps over the horizon  my father is one of these men boat builders in winter months and fishers of lobster the rest of the year  i have worked with him on the boat since i was ten and have been able to drink up the beauty of the shore while strengthening my relationship with him  this summertime work has taught me a lot about who i am  living in a town like this one learns to appreciate simpler things in life  at night one might go for a row in the harbour and glide across the rippled reflections of silvery street lights  exercise can be obtained by hiking a mossy trail and the best therapy for a stressful day is curling up by the shore with a crisp apple and a good book  after this summer i will be moving out into the real world to experience what life is really like  i am excited about the many opportunities in store for me but as i move forward i wont leave the past behind  i will take the smalltown values with me  no matter where i am i know i will always be able to close my eyes and smell the salty sea breeze of cutler the town that will always be my home  what is stated about cutler according to paragraph  it attracts landscape painters  it lies in spectacular scenery  it is a popular tourist destination  it has a rich century history  what is not mentioned about the inhabitants of cutler in paragraph  they have much in common  they are ready to give a hand  they maintain close links  they live a life of luxury    how do the residents of cutler earn their living by taking tourists on hikes by doing seasonal jobs by renting their boats to visitors by breeding lobsters in the harbour   what does the phrase the best therapy in paragraph  mean medical treatment suitable exercise a way of relaxation a kind of advisory service   what does the author say about herself the work with her father has shaped her personality  she has decided to continue her father’s trade  she has unclear memories of the past  the idea of leaving her hometown scares her    world’s most unusual cafes neko cafe themed cafes have been appearing all over japan  among the strangest these neko japanese for cat cafes originated in taiwan and have since been imported to tokyo  one of the most famous cat’s store allows customers to get a coffee and at the same time enjoy cats companionship in a city where limited space often means dog or catfree apartments  people come in to relax many regularly  most stay for over an hour others for the whole day  some have admitted to taking a sick day to spend time with cats  at about   an hour it’s a pricey cup of coffee but an inexpensive therapy session  which cafe  makes its waiters wear a special uniform offers a limited number of drinks gives a chance to see a performance maintains favourable conditions for work has some books to read in gives a chance to buy a present for your beloved provides its customers with relief from stress encourages you to join a charity project  chocolate cafe who needs coffee when you have chocolate and this tokyo cafe beautifully designed by masamichi katayama serves up an unthinkable variety —  different kinds to be exact — housed in their lovely chocolate library  you can pick the chocolates you want by number to put together your own custom box of chocolate  for valentine’s day  chocolate cafe has some decidedly nongiri obligation chocolates including one called number  which is a raspberry and strawberry chocolate billed as a specially blended chocolate for sweethearts   urban station the idea of using a coffee shop as your own personal office is probably pretty familiar to students intellectuals writers freelancers and people who like to read in silence  and although it’s not all that strange we really like the concept of designing cafes meant to serve as workspace  a new wave of cafeoffice hybrids such as urban station in buenos aires has been appearing offering wifi electrical outlets and spacious tables!  disaster cafe this cafe and restaurant is strictly for those with a strong stomach and not because of the food  food’s been called quite good but customers here rarely say that their meal’s been a typical one  this is probably due to the simulated earthquakes that occur  everything in the underground restaurant is designed to withstand a   earthquake  the plates and glasses are heavy so they remain still and the staff have to put on safety gear though mostly for show  don’t worry there have been no injuries yet  one tiny warning food and drinks have been known to spill during the seismic simulation so dress accordingly  corner perk this cafe is not unusual in decor or theme it’s not home to cats and it’s standing on the firm ground  what’s strange about it is that youre likely to get your coffee without paying for it  sounds hard to believe the customers are just as surprised  it all started when a good samaritan a woman who has chosen to remain anonymous left a  bill with the owner josh cooke to pay for everyone who ordered after her until the money was gone  she continues to make the donation every few months and has inspired others to follow suit some just stop in to make their donation   la distributrice walking down montroyal in montreal you might miss this holelikeinthewall cafe which is neatly tucked below a staircase  la distributrice occupies the smallest retail space in the city and claims the title of the smallest cafe in north america  the barista makes three kinds of coffee — americano espresso and latte — and serves it through a little window year round  if it weren’t for the bench and greenery neatly positioned around the tiny space outside youd hardly call it a cafe  it’s a tiny coffee shop with big coffee taste   elephant smashes house then saves a crying baby an angry elephant smashed a house in an indian village on monday night but when it   the animal turned back and carefully removed the parts of the ruined wall from the infant’s body  dipak mahato and his wife lalita were eating dinner when they

      "tips for choosing a career choosing a career is one of those momentous decisions that can change the course of your life  here are some tips to help you choose a satisfying career that you will enjoy for years to come   one of your tasks should be to choose a career where you can earn enough money to meet your objectives  if you want to own a vacation home on every continent and fly to these homes on your private jet a career as a retail clerk will probably not help you achieve your ambitions  you may have to make some compromises along the way but generally speaking the career you choose should allow you to earn a living  consider your personality type invest in your education reasonably register with an employment agency get reallife experience set your personal financial goals hire a career coach use selfassessment tools sign up with an advice website before you pay — or worse borrow money — for college or graduate school make sure the career you choose is worth the expense  according to the national centre for education statistics the cost of an undergraduate college education rose  to  percent between  and   if you need additional education to qualify for your dream job look into programmes that repay your student loans if you work in a public service position for a few years after graduation  youll spend onethird of your life with the people you work with so choose a career that’s a good community fit  if youre a loner who doesn’t enjoy public interaction you may be wellsuited to a career where you work independently or work from home  if you love to meet new people you may find a career in sales where you work with the public    use doityourself resources to help you narrow your career choices  take quizzes to help you understand certain types of work  review online job descriptions and career information from the bureau of labour statistics to help you learn what the education and training requirements are for different kinds of jobs  many books and workbooks are also available to guide you through this process    follow the example of companies that use interns and temps to evaluate an individual before they extend a job offer  staying in the environment where you think you want to work can help you make up your mind for certain  job shadows internships and temporary assignments give you a downtoearth view of a day in the life of a profession    plasticeating waxworms the global plastic bag pollution crisis could be solved by a waxworm capable of eating through the material at high speeds  researchers have described the tiny worm’s ability to break down even the toughest plastics as extremely exciting and said the discovery could be engineered into an environmentallyfriendly solution on an industrial scale  commonly found living in bee hives the waxworm proved it could eat its way through polyethylene which is extremely hard to break down more than  times faster than other organisms  scientists believe the creature has powerful enzymes which attack plastic’s chemical bonds in the same way they eat the complex wax found in hives  the waxworm’s potential was discovered by accident when biologist and amateur beekeeper federica bertocchini cleaned out her hives and temporarily placed the parasites in a plastic shopping bag  she soon noticed it was full of holes  in tests at cambridge  waxworms were let loose on a plastic bag from a british supermarket with holes appearing after just  minutes  over a period of  hours  mg of plastic had been consumed  by contrast previous trials using bacteria had found the microbes could only work through   mg of plastic in  hours  the creatures transformed the polyethylene into an unbonded substance called ethylene glycol  dr  bertocchini who led the research said the challenge for us will be to try and identify the molecular processes in this reaction and see if we can isolate the enzyme responsible for it  we are planning to implement this finding to get rid of plastic waste working towards a solution to save our oceans rivers and the entire environment from the unavoidable consequences of plastic accumulation  quite aside from how and where to farm all waxworms there’s something about them that news reports have failed to mention  specifically these worms love to eat the wax from which bees make their honeycombs — and so they can destroy bee colonies  waxworms are thought to cause more than  million’s worth of damage annually in the united states alone  with bee populations already under severe stress from pesticides habitat loss and predators researchers should think twice about breeding one of their worst enemies in huge numbers  one way or another these days around a trillion plastic bags are used around the world each year of which a huge number find their way into the oceans or landfills  with the waxworm discovery being still far from the solution to the world’s piles of garbage everybody can do a lot to reduce plastic waste by bringing their own shopping bags giving up bottled water rethinking their food storage etc  what do waxworms do according to the text they steal honey from bees  they grow faster eating plastic  they are the easiest animals to breed  they are the quickest plastic eaters  what is true of federica bertocchini she has discovered a new ability of worms  she gathers honey from the hive for a living  she raised waxworms in shopping bags  she has invented a new remedy for bee parasites    what steps are the scientists going to take to study the plasticbreaking mechanism to speed up waxworms reproduction to research waxworms other abilities to experiment with different plastics   what are the disadvantages of putting the discovery into practice it is too expensive  it threatens nature  it is timeconsuming  it lacks professionals    how can people contribute to solving a plastic waste problem according to the text clean ocean shores raise money for research change their habits sort out their garbage   travel pioneers from innovators who are leading the pack to explorers who are experiencing the world in a new way — travel pioneers will change the way you think about

      " proven benefits of country living science shows that living in the country is beneficial in many respects   the further out into the country you get the more air quality improves including less pollution and greater abundance of trees and grass  pollution in more heavilypopulated areas comes not only from a lack of greenery but also from tiny yet harmful particles released into the air from trucks buses cars factories and other mainstays of urban environments  these particles travel into the lungs and increase the risk of a serious illness  easy access to healthy food plenty of outdoor entertainments increased rate of safety great opportunities for doing sports favourable climate for psychological health low cost of living hospitality of local farmers ideal conditions for breathing residents in rural areas are less likely to be victims of a wide range of crimes versus those who live in the city or suburbs  part of the reason for this is just there are fewer people in the country thus less opportunity for crime to occur  there’s also a higher percentage of police officers per capita  crime can happen anywhere and the country certainly isn’t guaranteed to be completely free of it  still if youre looking to live somewhere where you can feel more comfortable letting your kids ride their bikes alone to school or leaving your windows open for a cool breeze while you sleep statistically the country is going to be your best bet    your brain actually functions differently in the country  living in an urban environment overstimulates two key regions of the brain the areas that regulate emotion and anxiety  scientists believe this is the reason they see higher rates of mental problems in cities than in nonurban areas  in the country the brain is less likely to experience this kind of overstimulation  the benefits are a lower risk of anxiety disorders and mood disorders    cities are expensive to live in  it’s already wellestablished that dwelling in the suburbs is cheaper than in the city  a study has found that those in the country pay less for everything from groceries to health care to transportation with the greatest price differentiation having to do with housing costs  of course what you pay to reside somewhere — and what you get for that money — is going to differ depending on your exact locality  but if you’re looking for somewhere to spend less and get more the first place you should start your search is in the country    out in my own country paradise i don’t have a whole foods shop within  miles of me but i do have multiple

in a tent in the wild    the hyatt empire the idea that a multibilliondollar empire was launched from a chance encounter in fat eddie’s coffee shop with a cheque written on a napkin seems like something    this very true story took place in the very first hyatt hotel across from los angeles airport  as legend has it in  businessman jay pritzker was killing time in fat eddie’s when he noticed    after a quick inquiry he discovered there would not be a vacancy for a few days  and that’s when jay pritzker had his epiphany  why only place highend hotels downtown so far from the airport business travellers would surely flock to luxurious accommodations that had the added convenience of being next to the airport  pritzker was so certain of this he arranged a meeting with the hotel owner a man named hyatt von dehn and they agreed on a sale price of   million on the spot  as pritzker did not have the forethought   he wrote a legally binding cheque on a napkin  jay partnered with his younger brother donald to turn this vision into a reality  the boys were the grandsons of jewish immigrants   and by the time they were born the family had achieved some success in the new world in various business ventures  the key to pritzker’s vision was combining convenience with luxury  today the airport hotel is as commonplace in any developed city    but in the late s this concept didn’t exist  of course jay pritzker’s vision was more than just airport hotels  he wanted the hyatt name to be synonymous with luxury and elite accommodations  pritzker saw the opportunity   the now worldfamous atlanta regency hotel opened its doors  by the end of the s the hyatt chain had grown to  hotels  who expanded hyatt into a chain of hotels that could only be found in a hollywood
